<p> This project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certification provided by Coursera and its main objective is to apply data science concepts to analyze a real-world scenario. </p>

# 1. Introduction
<p>
One of the current concerns of the Seattle Department of Transportation is to find solutions that can minimize the number of car accidents, as well as fatalities, injuries and damages due to traffic accidents, however, before solving a problem it is extremely important to study it and understand it in full. In this context, all relevant information of occurrences is recorded and maintained by the department for the access of all researchers.

This project intends to use these records to analyze all the collisions recorded from 2003 to October 2020 in order to build a Machine Learning Model that allows the severity of an accident to be classified by its characteristics.

<p> To achieve the objective, the project applies the CRISP-DM methodology, which is a model focused on communication, flexibility and iteration at each stage of the project to keep it on track. The CRISP-DM methodology contains 6 stages that are:
